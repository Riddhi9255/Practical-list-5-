Write a C++ program to demonstrate use of Multiple Inheritance.
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

// First base class
class Vehicle {
public:
    void start() {
       cout <<" mahemdavadi riddhi j 220130318035 ";
        cout << "Vehicle started." << endl;
    }

    void stop() {
        cout << "Vehicle stopped." << endl;
    }
};

// Second base class
class Engine {
public:
    void ignite() {
        cout << "Engine ignited." << endl;
    }

    void shutdown() {
        cout << "Engine shut down." << endl;
    }
};

// Derived class inheriting from both Vehicle and Engine
class Car : public Vehicle, public Engine {
public:
    void drive() {
        cout << "Car is being driven." << endl;
    }

    void park() {
        cout << "Car is parked." << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Car myCar;

    myCar.start();   // Accessing method from Vehicle
    myCar.ignite();  // Accessing method from Engine

    myCar.park();    // Accessing method from Car
    myCar.stop();    // Accessing method from Vehicle
    myCar.shutdown(); // Accessing method from Engine
