Write a C++ program to demonstrate order of constructor calls in 
Multiple Inheritance.
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

// First base class
class Base1 {
public:
    Base1() {
         cout<<" mahemdavadi riddhi j ", 220130318035 ;
        cout << "Constructor of Base1" << endl;
    }
};

// Second base class
class Base2 {
public:
    Base2() {
        cout << "Constructor of Base2" << endl;
    }
};

// Derived class inheriting from both Base1 and Base2
class Derived : public Base1, public Base2 {
public:
    Derived() {
        cout << "Constructor of Derived" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Derived obj;

    return 0;
}
